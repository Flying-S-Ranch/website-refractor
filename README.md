# Website Refractor

## Description
The aim of this project is to refractor an existing webpage by organizing HTML and CSS elements. While the webpage itself should be unchanged, it is my goal to make the code easier to read and follow. This project enables me to practice what we have learned about HTML and CSS, including the use of semantic elements, class and id descriptions, and alternate descriptions for images.

## Installation
There are no special instructions for installation. To acces the webpage, open [https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/challenge-1/](https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/website-refractor/) in your internet browser. 

## Usage
To see the HTML and CSS code in action, access the 'Inspect' feature in your browser. See especially the use of semantic elements in the HTML code and the alt descriptions in image elements.

## Credits
This project involved no direct collaboration, but I benefitted from the assistance of the instructor, TA, and classmates to answer questions about the project requirements and how to put the web page into an online repository. I also made use of class materials to help me solve problems within the project.
